        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">I currently work in warehouse logistics and have been in management for over 16 years. I earned my associate degree
          in graphic design in 2010 and recently decided to pursue a degree in software development. Outside of work and academics, I have a 
          few hobbies. I love playing flag football and basketball, and Im working on finding time to get back in shape and join
          a men's kickball or basketball league. My five-year-old son keeps me busy with his sports, he plays baseball and
          mixed martial arts and loves video games, especially Fortnite. Sometimes, I join him, unless Im playing Call of Duty with my friends. 
          When Im not gaming, Im usually working on my project car a 2010 Ford Mustang or revamping my clothing brand.</p>
      

        <span class="sentence">My goal is to become a skilled web developer and create meaningful digital experiences.</span>
